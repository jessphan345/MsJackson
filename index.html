      <p>My baby's drama mama, don't like me</p>
      <p>be doing things like having them boys come from her neighborhood</p>
      <p>To the studio trying to fight me</p>
      <p>She need to get a, piece of the american pie and take her bite out</p>
      <p>That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out</p>
      <p>And let her know her grandchild is a baby, and not a paycheck</p>
      <p>Private school, daycare, shit medical bills I pay that</p>
      <p>I love your mom and everything, but see I ain't the one who laid down</p>
      <p>She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down</p>
      <p>Shit you never got a chance to hear my side of the story we was divided</p>
      <p>She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday I ain't invited</p>
      <p>Despite it, I show her the utmost respect when I fall through</p>
      <p>All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah</p>
      </p>

      <p>Me and yo' daughter, got's this thing going on
        (We got a special kind of thing going on)</p>
      <p>You say it's puppy love</p>
      <p>We say it's full grown</p>
      <p>Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever</p>
      <p>You can plan a pretty picnic</p>
      <p>But you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson</p>
      <p>Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin' fine</p>
      <p>The quickest muzzle throw it on my mouth and I'll decline</p>
      <p>King meets queen, then the puppy love thing, together dream</p>
      <p>Bout that crib with the Goodyear swing</p>
      <p>On the oak tree, I hope we feel like this forever</p>
      <p>Forever, forever, ever, forever, ever?</p>
      <p>Forever never seems that long until you're grown</p>
      <p> And notice that the day by day ruler can't be too wrong</p>
      <p>Ms. Jackson my intentions were good I wish I could</p>
      <p>Become a magician to abacadabra all the sadder</p>
      <p>Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he</p>
      <p>Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me</p>
      <p>Had, I pray so much about it need some knee, pads</p>
      <p>It happened for a reason one can't be, mad</p>
      <p>So know this, know that everything's cool</p>
      <p>And yes I will be present on the first day of school, and graduation</p>

      <p>Uh, uh, yeah</p>
      <p>"Look at the way he treats me"</p>
      <p>Shit, look at the way you treat me</p>
      <p>You see your little nosy-ass home girls</p>
      <p> Done got your ass sent up the creek G</p>
      <p>Without a paddle, you left to straddle</p>
      <p>And ride this thing on out</p>
      <p>Now you and your girl ain't speaking no more</p>
      <p>Cause my dick all in her mouth</p>
      <p>Know what I'm talking about? Jealousy, infidelity, envy</p>
      <p>Cheating to beating, envy and to the G they be the same thing</p>
      <p>So who you placing the blame on, you keep on singing the same song</p>
      <p>Let bygones be bygones, you can go on and get the hell on
        You and your mama</p>
